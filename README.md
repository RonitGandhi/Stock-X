**Stock Recommendation System README**

## Objective
This project aims to develop a stock recommendation system that provides recommendations based on trending stock news and financial data. The system utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis of financial news articles and extracts relevant stocks mentioned in the news for further analysis. Recommendations are generated based on sentiment analysis and financial fundamentals.

## Scope
The stock recommendation system targets individual investors interested in leveraging news sentiment and financial metrics to make informed investment decisions. The system will be implemented using Python programming language and various libraries for data collection, text processing, sentiment analysis, and financial data retrieval.

## Step-by-Step Approach

### 1. Define Objectives and Scope
- Clearly define the objectives of the recommendation system.
- Determine the target audience, technologies, and expected outcomes.

### 2. Research and Learning
- Familiarize with NLP, sentiment analysis, and financial analysis concepts.
- Explore available APIs and libraries for data collection and analysis.

### 3. Set Up Development Environment
- Install necessary tools and libraries, including Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, requests, nltk, etc.
- Establish version control using Git for code management.

### 4. Data Collection
- Start with a small dataset for testing.
- Utilize APIs like Google News API and Yahoo Finance API for fetching financial news articles and stock data.

### 5. Text Processing and Sentiment Analysis
- Implement text processing techniques to clean and preprocess news articles.
- Use sentiment analysis libraries (e.g., TextBlob, VADER) to analyze sentiment.

### 6. Financial Data Retrieval
- Fetch financial data and fundamentals for mentioned stocks using Yahoo Finance API.

### 7. Filtering and Recommendation
- Develop algorithms to filter stocks based on sentiment and financial metrics.
- Implement scoring mechanisms to recommend top stocks.

### 8. Testing and Evaluation
- Test the system using historical data and real-time news articles.
- Evaluate performance based on accuracy, precision, and recall.

### 9. Refinement and Optimization
- Refine recommendation algorithms based on feedback and evaluation results.
- Optimize the system for efficiency and scalability.

### 10. Documentation and Deployment
- Document the project methodology, algorithms, and instructions for running the system.
- Deploy the system to a suitable environment for production use.

### 11. Continuous Improvement
- Monitor system performance and collect user feedback for continuous improvement.
- Incorporate new features and improvements based on community engagement.

## Conclusion
By following this step-by-step approach, the stock recommendation system will be systematically developed and deployed, providing valuable insights for individual investors to make informed investment decisions based on sentiment analysis and financial data.
